## 3.0.0

In 3.0 a lot of the internals were re-tooled to monkeypatch less so they behave more like what you would expect.

The `Maildown::MarkdownEngine.set` was deprecated and is removed. instead use `Maildown::MarkdownEngine.set_html`.

Layouts are now used by default. This setting is deprecated and does nothing:

```ruby
Maildown.enable_layouts = true
```

There is no way to disable layouts via maildown, instead use normal Rails methods, such as moving to a mailer without a layout set.

## 2.0.3

- Add support for using a different template for HTML and TEXT parts of the markdown email. Enable with `Maildown.enable_layouts = true`.

## 2.0.2

- Add support for "allow indentation". When `Maildown.allow_indentation = true`. This allows erb markdown templates to be indented but disables blockquotes via spaces. More information is available in the readme.
